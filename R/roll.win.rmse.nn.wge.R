#  big problem with passing mlp an old model is that it doesn't always change the difforder.
# Sometimes it overrides the old model difforder so there is code to manually force difforder to be 0
# by overwriting the instantiated mlp object (in the loop) wiht the old model difforder.  
# There is an excel file (RollWindowNNCheck.xlsx) that does the MSE calculation by hand to double check but the below 
# code compares the mlp function MSE to the rolling window MSE for horizon 1 which should be the MSE.  
# Two issues arise
# 1. The code automatically checks for trend and uses the forecast::ets function which requires a series of at least 8.
# Therefore, the rolling window RMSE won't match exactly because it is always missing the first 8 windows. (But it should be close).
# 2. The difforder is not always taken from the old model and windows with perceived trend will difference 
# when there shouldn't be one. The fix for this is to manually force difforder to
# overwrite the instantiated mlp object's difforder (in the loop) with the old model difforder.
